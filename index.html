    <h1 class="shimmer">Jayasurya Palagiri</h1>
    <p>
      Born and raised in Hyderabad, I’ve always had an eye for how people solve problems—not just in business, but in life. I studied at Oakridge International School, Newton Campus, where the IB curriculum sparked my interest in systems thinking, behavioral economics, and how decisions play out in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at Christ University Bangalore, pursuing a BBA in Finance and International Business, I’m focused on observing, learning, and contributing. From coordinating student-led finance sessions to supporting local awareness drives, I’ve been actively involved in things that make students and communities think better, act smarter, and collaborate more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m deeply into basketball—not just for the thrill, but for how it mirrors business: momentum, timing, spacing, and trust. I also spend time understanding public markets, business models, and occasionally arguing with friends about valuation logic. I’m not in a rush to start something big, but I know I will—when the right opportunity meets the right readiness.
